OK, listen here, m-fasa, I don't know why are you here and I don't want to know anyway.
So, here's the deal - you may use those commands, but don't even think to dig dirt on me, got it?
Here's the list:

The first group of commands requires a picture to work with. So, there are two options for now:
1) Send pic directly to bot
2) Put link after the command, like that: /<command> <options> <link>
3) You can also try to send to bot, what exactly you looking for: /<command> <options> <query> (like, /jpeg 2 dog)
If the bot couldn't find any pic - nothing will happen.
So, here they are:
/magik - liquid rescale (ex.: /magik or /magik 5 or /magik 2, etc.)
/gmagik - liquid rescale but in jif (ex.: /gmagik or /gmagik ext)
/triggered - triggered jif
/glitch (/glitch2) - glitching image or jif (ex.: /glitch or /glitch 15 50 18 or /glitch2 etc.)
/jpeg - more jpeg (ex.: /jpeg or /jpeg 5 or /jpeg 2, etc.)
/eye (/eyes) - applying stupid eyes to photo (ex.: /eye 9 or /eye list for help)

The second group does not require an image. But some of them might need options. 
Otherwise, there will be some random result or even nothing in return.
/badmeme - random badmeme
/gif - random jif (ex.: /gif your dad think you were a mistake)
/retro1 (/retro2, /retro3) - making retro text (ex.: /retro2 Hitler|Did|9/11). Use | as separator
/help - I dunno, maybe help message?
If you want to notify me about my thash-like spelling or/and punctuation, 
just send me an e-mail: whocares@not.me 
And yeah - there's come more
